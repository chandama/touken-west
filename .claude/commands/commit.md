# Commit Current Changes

Follow these steps to commit the current changes:

1. **Get current status**: Run `git status` and `git branch --show-current` to see the current branch and all changed files.

2. **Show changes summary**: Run `git diff --stat` to show a summary of what changed.

3. **Ask for confirmation**: Use the AskUserQuestion tool to confirm:
   - Show the current branch name
   - Show a brief summary of the changes (files modified/added/deleted)
   - Ask "Proceed with commit?" with options Yes/No

4. **If confirmed**, ask the user for a commit message using AskUserQuestion with a text input. Suggest a concise commit message based on the changes.

5. **Stage and commit**:
   - Run `git add -A` to stage all changes
   - Create the commit with the user's message
   - Do NOT include any AI attribution, "Generated by", "Co-Authored-By: Claude", or similar in the commit message
   - The commit message should be clean and professional, as if written by the developer

6. **Show result**: Run `git log -1 --oneline` to confirm the commit was created.

IMPORTANT: Never mention AI, Claude, Claude Code, or any AI attribution in commit messages. Keep commits clean and professional.
